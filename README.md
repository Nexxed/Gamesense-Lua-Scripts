# Others
## [Tick Helper](tickhelper.ljbc)
A script to easily toggle between fake lag, on-shot anti-aim and double tap, as well as adjusting the behaviour after/during these modes.
Compiled because the code is messy :(

## [Custom ESP library](ESP/)
This script allows you to build your own ESP and acts as a library or wrapper for all the complicated math needed to draw text and bars. An example is included too so you can learn how to use it properly.
